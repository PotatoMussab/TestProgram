# TestProgram
This is just a Java program that I had to do for a job interview. It generates all strings from AAAA to ZZZZ in a text file, loads them into memory
and then the user can search for one (or more) of the strings. The goal of the program might have been misunderstood but the underlying concept is
the same regardless.
